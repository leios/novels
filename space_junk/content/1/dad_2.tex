\section*{On stargazing}

\noindent Hey Dad,

\begin{noteblock}{A bit harsh on myself, I guess, but no one is going to read this anyway, so who cares?}
It's me again.
You know, the son who never seems to shut up about things you couldn't care less about?
Yeah, that one.
\end{noteblock}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{gave me an appreciation for history}
\item{Kessler catastrophe}
\end{enumerate}
