\chapter*{This novel is a work of fiction}

Again, in case you didn't read the section title, this novel is a work of fiction.
That said, I will try my best to clarify which elements are and are not scientifically accurate \footnote{... and I will probably be doing this through footnotes or bibliography entries}.

As another important note, this book is freely available online footnote{at https://github.com/leios/novels/space junk} under a Creative Commons License\footnote{In particular, a Creative Commons Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share-Alike (CC-BY-NC-SA) license. This means that anyone is free to use this work for anything they like, so long as it is not for a commercial purpose and any derivative works have the same license.
If people use this work, they must attribute me, Dr. James Schloss (Leios)}.
If possible, I would like to have discussion about this work available on github for everyone to see and take part in.
In fact, because of my licensing and openness, I am not going to try to publish this through traditional means; therefore, if you notice any typos, loose narrative threads, poor writing, etc, feel free to create an issue (or pull request online).
