# Space Junk concept

The story takes place maybe 100 years in the future after rapid re-industrialization due to a push against climate change.
After this, humanity once again focused it's efforts to space and began colonizing other planets, namely Venus and Mars; however, expiditions to far reaching planets still happen quite frequently and space travel has effectively been commodotized.

That said, there is one small hitch, due to the rapid re-industrialization, there is a huge amount of space junk in Earth's atmosphere. [1]
Honestly, AI can do 99% of all space flights, and in the absense of this space junk, it would be able to do 100% of it.
This means that the region right outside of Earth's orbit is the most difficult place to traverse in space.
As more satellites are launched, it only becomes more and challenging.

At this stage, there are so many satellites in the sky that true stars have not been seen for half a century.
Shooting stars are just falling satellites that can cause massive damage if too big.

Note that researchers are well aware of the risks of satellites running into each other and causing their shrapnel to destroy other satellites in a run-away chan reaction.
Instead of directly addressing the problem by trying to remove te space junk (which admittedly is a hard problem), governments instead chose to build AI that can spot where any shrapnel might be coming from and avoid it.
Otherwise, the have built any new satellites with an incredibly tough alloy so shrapnel dust no longer affects it.

To clean the space junk, there needs to be:
1. A political will
2. A way to catelog where the junk is
3. A way to collect it
4. A way to make money off of it.

This story follows Leia, the first ever space janitor who comes from humble beginnings with her father in a remote fishing village.
