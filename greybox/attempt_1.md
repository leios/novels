# My perspective

Teachers teach.
Students learn.
Some students learn better than others and are inspired to teach, so they teach as they were taught.
After centuries of this process repeating itself over and over again, educational systems around the world all follow a similar pattern:

1. The instructor stands before a classroom with some number of students.
2. They teach what they've been taught through speach, gestures, diagrams, and any other form of expression.
3. Students are expected to absorb the material being presented and keep it somewhere safe for later.
4. They then do homework to keep the ideas in place for a little longer.
5. Finally, the teacher gives an exam to the students to make sure they learned what they should have learned.

This system allows teachers to scale their lessons to different classroom sizes.
More importantly, it works. It's always worked. That is why we collectively continue to do it day after day, year after year.

But what if you are a student who doesn't do well in classes?
What if you need a little more time to understand a topic deeply before continuing? Well, you are stupid.
What if you are too quick and get bored, causing you to lose focus? Well, you have some form of attention disorder.
What if you have testing anxiety and cannot think straight in a high-pressure environment? Well, you are just going to have to get over it.

The fact is that no two students are alike, but that doesn't matter.
Modern educational systems are not intended to teach individual students, they are meant to teach the population at-large.
If it's only 80% effective, that's totally fine!
If it discourages exploration and learning, that's also fine!
