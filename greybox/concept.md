There is an unspoken rule that students subconsciously learned through school: there is always a "right" answer.
The problem is that this philosophy is completely flawed.
Rarely, if ever, is there a 100% correct thing to do.
Rarely is there an action so reprehensibly awful that someone cannot recover from it.

In life, as long as you are acting in good faith and doing your best to achieve a goal, the goal is almost never unattainable.

That said, I do understand why schools are set up as they are.
It all has to do with the economy of scale.
If there is only one teacher to every 30 students, it's impossible to teach the nuances to every topic.
Instead, teachers must create curricula that fit *most* of their students, leaving the outliers to fend for themselves.

Around 10 years ago, new technology was developed to better tailor the learning experience to every individual.
On the outside, it looked like a simple grey box with an unassuming door.
On the inside, it was a world unique to each individual.
This allowed students to have AI mentors that were theirs and theirs alone.

Sure, tests were still needed, as were traditional lectures, but by allowing students to be alone and learn at their own pace for at least an hour a day was found to be incredibly fruitful.
I was one of the first generations of students to be raised with the greybox technology and remember vividly the first time I used the device.

The moment I opened the door, I was surrounded by a green, grassy meadow with small white flowers speckled throughout.
A light breeze created waves of grass under a blue sky and clouds.
There was no sun, which I found odd, but everything else was picturesque.

Suddenly, I heard a somewhat feminine voice, "Hello. Are you ready to begin your training?"
I looked around but saw no one in particular.

I figured it was just part of the experience and spoke into the air, "Sure. What are we doing?"

"Great!" The voice seemed to change a bit. It was softer, as if it was already learning what style would work best for a student like me. It continued, "There are many different techniques to learn. What would you like to do first?"

I didn't really know how to respond. Was I supposed to know my own curriculum? I guessed so, so I said, "Teach me whatever *you* think is the most interesting."

"I am an AI. I don't have an opinion."

"Right, well teach me what I need to know then."

There was no response. In fact, for the next few minutes, nothing seemed to happen at all. Confused, I sat in the grass and stared at the sky a bit. "Hello?" I asked.

Still no response. Did I somehow confuse it?

"Hello?" I asked again, "What am I supposed to be learning here?"

After another delay, the voice responded, "I am afraid I cannot teach you."

"What do you mean?"

"I have not been programmed to deal with a student like you."

I tried pressing further, but the voice was gone after that.
At the end of the hour, the door behind me opened up and my teacher greeted me, saying, "Your time is up for today. You can continue again tomorrow."

After school, I talked to my friends about what they did in the greybox. I was surprised to hear a variety of responses:

* I learned nature magic. Simple stuff, like how to move dirt.
* We did some swordsmanship training.
* I was thirsty, so I learned how to make water from thin air.

When they asked me, I told them. "I did nothing."

The next day, I told my teacher what happened.
They were initially confused, but ultimately said, "I think it is part of the process. Just keep going and see what happens."

So I did.
The next day was the same.
Big grassy meadow.
No voice.

Well, fine. I figured I would teach myself.

Every day, after class I would ask my friends what they were learning and then replicate the lessons in the greybox the next day...
