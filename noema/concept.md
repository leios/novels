Noema is a girl that has the ability to create life by creating sculptures and imbuing them with part of her soul. She doesn't realize that each creation causes her to die a little. At the end of the day, her creations come together to bring her back to life.

This could be a dual story with Grim, as he might be able to uniquely recognize the creations as Jackie.

I am not sure how this book should progress, but can imagine a few different possibilities:
1. The Grim storyline. Grim and Jackie work together. Grim learns more and more about Jackie as she gets closer and closer to death. Grim then recognizes she is dying, but also finds her sculptures and is able to resurrect her.
2. The story could be from the perspective of her creations and in the world that she made. All of the objects could recognize her as their "god" and then realize they must sacrifice themselves for her to live
3. It could be explicitly from Noema's perspective. She finds herself dying and then wakes up only to find her creations have died for her. This one could have a nice scene after she has dies where she lives through her different creations as they decide it is best to end their lives to save their creator.

In some sense, each creature should be a manifestation of her soul. I don't know how, exactly.

## Intro
I was a lonely kid growing up. I knew lot's of people, but never considered them to be my friend. To be honest, I wasn't bullied or anything, I just couldn't connect with children my age. While they were playing together, I often found myself alone, idly pulling on grass and thinking to myself.

Our home was somewhat rural. I don't even think we had a neighbor in walking distance. Because of this, from a young age, my parents often let me roam about unsupervised. Our house was located in the middle forest next to a small stream, which became my go-to thinking spot. I would often bring a notebook and pen to scribble away for hours, undisturbed by anyone.

One day, I found myself in the middle of a creative block and put down my paper to waded through the river. On the other side, I picked up a stone and threw it into the water, creating a satisfying splash. I did this a few more times before siting on the river bank and dipping my hands in the sand.

Eventually, I found myself sculpting a small creature. To be honest, I didn't really know what I was doing and ended up making a small humanoid sand monster. I tried again with a clear goal in mind: I wanted to make a cat. I did not make a cat. It looked more like a house.

So I tried again and again, each time getting better and better. After a few days of doing this, I could create convincing characters in the sand. The problem was that no matter how hard I tried to keep them in good condition, they would completely disintegrate by the next day.

To be honest, I wasn't necessarily upset about this. After all, the sculptures were made of sand. Still, it felt like a part of myself died every day, and after a few weeks I more or less lost interest in sculpting altogether, returning to my notebook to scribble about.

A few weeks later, I began to draw circles in my notebook. I don't really know what I was trying to do, but I wanted to create a really fancy design and thought the circle was a good, simple shape to base the design off of. I tried a bunch of different patterns: circles in circles, lines stretching from one region of the page to another, even weird glyphs outlining the major shapes. I didn't know what I drew, but it looked cool.

I silently nodded to myself, proud of what I had done, but as I closed the notebook, the paper slid across my finger causing a paper cut. I quickly shoved my finger in my mouth, but not before a drop of blood fell onto the page. I was initially somewhat distraught, thinking that I had ruined my work, but then noticed something rather peculiar.

The entire pattern began to glow a deep red. It then began to flash repeatedly and forced itself open, flying a few feet from my hands and onto the ground. Of course, I was in utter disbelief. This was the closest thing to magic I had ever seen. It was the first time in my life that I ever wished for a friend to show them something cool.

If course, there wasn't anyone else around. Just me. It was always just me.

Regardless, I took a few steps forward to inspect the notebook. Any sensible person, would have run or at least stayed far away from whatever just happened. I was not, nor have I ever been, a sensible person. I instead decided to run my finger along the page, eventually placing my palm on the center.

In that moment, the page flashed a bright white such that I needed to shield my eyes with my other hand. In that time, I felt a strong wind push my dress between my legs. Strangely, the wind seemed to be coming *from* my notebook. In a second, the wind stopped and I decided to open my eyes. By this time, the book was no longer glowing, but my hands were. Not quite as brightly as the book was, but they were emitting a subtle golden hue.

In that moment, I don't know why, but I felt a strong urge to sculpt, so I knelt down, grabbed some sand and began to make the figure of a cat. It was the most realistic sculpture I had ever made. I even used small pine needles to act as whiskers and fur. All the while, my hands continued to glow. 

In my mind, I began imagining a small black kitten. It would be cute and playful, but also oddly territorial, always patrolling the riverbed for fish, but never wandering too far off. I remember thinking about every detail of the cat, painting an incredibly vivid picture in my mind, and as I did so, the sculpture began to glow, first gold and then a brilliant white.

I had to shield my eyes once again, but before I opened them, I heard an odd noise. A *purring*. Soon, I felt a small, fuzzy creature crawl into my lap. When I looked down, there was a kitten staring up at me. This wasn't just any kitten. It was *the* kitten I had just made. Every detail was exactly the same as I imagined.

I was admittedly a little freaked out. I jumped, grabbed my notebook and ran. I don't know why *that* was the moment that got me. It wasn't the notebook glowing and flying away. It wasn't the weird urge to create something. It was a very real cat staring me in the eyes.

At some point, I felt like I was going crazy and looked back towards the river, only to see the cat still staring from the distance. After that, I went home and decided to take a nap, where I had a strange dream of *being* the cat and hunting for fish.

I opted not to go to the river the next day, and instead wanted to scribble in my notebook on my bed. As I thumbed through all of my old drawings, I came across my circle scribble and again ran my finger across it. The ink seemed normal. It looked like a normal drawing outside of the blood from the paper cut that was dribbled across it.

That night, I dreamt of the kitten again, shivering in the cold, unable to sleep. She was next to the river, laying on a rock not too far from where I first met her. I found myself deeply troubled by the dream and grabbed a small cloth from the garage before jogging into the forest.

I found the cat exactly where she was in the dream. She clearly heard me as I approached, as she began purring loudly. When I was a few meters away, she hopped up and began rubbing herself against my legs. I sat on the ground and laid the cloth out for her, but she was fixated on me, pushing herself against every available inch of my body.

After some time, I stood up and began to walk away. She followed, but eventually decided to go back to the river. When I was back home, I dreamt of her curled up, using the cloth as a blanket and sleeping soundly.
