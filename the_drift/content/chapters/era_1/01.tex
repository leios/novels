\chapter{The Lecture}

The world is changing.
The world has always been changing and will always continue to change.
In many ways, the human experience is about adapting to and capitalizing on that change.
This is why research is so fundamental to humanity.
Someone, somehow needs to explore the unknown, pushing the boundary of human knowledge forward one step at a time.

Sure, there are bad papers.
There are scientists with poor work ethic.
There are studies with improper methods.
There are spurrious initiatives that don't lead anywhere,

But without out fundamental curiosity leading us to question everything, we would never have developed as much as we have.

As long as we strive to learn more and reach into the unknown, the world will contiue to change, and that's a good thing.
A really good thing.

Anyone who stands in the way of progress, stands in the way of humanity, itself.
