You are a scientist that has recently descovered a gravitational collision between our galaxy and another one nearby.
This collision causes all the planets away from the sun, not only counteracting the effects of climate change, but completely reversing them and causing the world to cool.
This causes many ignorant people, including many politicians, to argue that the scientific method is inherently flawed as scientists consistently "lie" to the population.
You now need to convince the world that fundamental research is still worth funding.
